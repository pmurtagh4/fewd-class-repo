## Project Description

Landing page for a fictional book publishing company. The website will dislay its newest title (a short novella), about us page, and contact page and an email subscribe palce holder. 

## Wireframes
The link provided is a one page wireframe for the Landing page for my fictional book publishing company website. I wanted to have a simple, modern look and feel that is relevent to the idea of the fictional book. The landing page consist of a main header, in which will show the title of the publishing company, then underneath that a subtitle of the announcement of the new title. At the top of this section, I am hoping to had a colorful top bar to give the site some more flare. The main section will then have a background image of the cover of a book. The next section of the site will be about the book and what type of story it is (i.e a synoposis of the book). Then underneath that section will be another section, but it will be an about section on the fictional company. Then finally, there will be a footer in which I will have the icons of twitter and instagram display to give social proof. 
Here is the link to the one-page draw up: https://res.cloudinary.com/dod6u4bjy/image/upload/v1535387290/GA_-_Final_Project_Wireframe.jpg
## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min
Here is a link to a draft of the project. Since this is a draft, I have not completed it. I just laid out what I want the final project to look like with some notes as to what I will be adding. (https://codepen.io/pmurtagh4/pen/GXNzrJ)
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Add user auth

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
